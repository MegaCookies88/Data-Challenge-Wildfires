# Data Challenge - Wildfires and their extremes: a global challenge

https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics/eva-2021/competitions/data-challenge

We focus on two important components of wildfire activity: wildfire occurrence, and wildfire size.
A comprehensive wildfire dataset covering the period from 1993 to 2015 for the continental United States is used. We exclude the state of Alaska and islands such as Hawaii.

The goal of this challenge is to estimate the predictive distributions of the number of wildfires (CNT) and aggregated burnt area of wildfires in acres (BA) for a validation set. The scores used for the competition are variants of weighted ranked probability scores.

## Repository files :
- wildfires.ipynb : Data analysis, visualization, some models.
- models.Rmd : Every tested model with results and prediction scores.
- prediction_cnt.R : Best CNT model and challenge distribution prediction.
- prediction_ba.R : Best BA model and challenge distribution prediction.
